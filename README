Smart404 provides a 'failsafe' for 404 requests.

Basically, if you link someone to foo.html when the real link is foo.php, this script will automatically go to foo.php, assuming foo.html does not exist.
It works for many different file types, including images, videos, audio, etc

To use, simply rename the file clone the repository to your document root.
