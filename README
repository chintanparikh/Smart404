Smart404 provides a 'failsafe' for 404 requests.

Basically, if you link someone to foo.html when the real link is foo.php, this script will automatically go to foo.php, assuming foo.html does not exist.

To use, simply rename the file 'RENAMETOHTACCESS' to '.htaccess' and copy and paste .htaccess and smart404/ to your web root.
